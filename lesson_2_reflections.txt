When you initialize a directory with git,
you are turning that directory into a git
repository. Git will then be able to keep
track of the history and make commits of
your repository.

The staging area is where you put all your
files in your repository/directory that you
are going to commit to the next commit.

Using the staging area helps you make logical
changes to your files because it let's you pick
and choose which files are ready to commit.

Branches are useful when you want to make
different versions of your programs and help
keep those different versions orginized.

Diagrams can help you visualize branches in
an easy and meaningful way.

The pros of Git's automatic merging is that it
makes it very easy for multiple people to work
on different parts of the same project. However
Git can't always guess the correct way to merge
files, sometimes you will have to manually look
at the code and decide what to keep in the final
file by yourself.
