When you initialize a directory with git,
you are turning that directory into a git
repository. Git will then be able to keep
track of the history and make commits of
your repository.

The staging area is where you put all your
files in your repository/directory that you
are going to commit to the next commit.

Using the staging area helps you make logical
changes to your files because it let's you pick
and choose which files are ready to commit.
